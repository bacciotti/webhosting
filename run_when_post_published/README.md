# Change the category to a new when post published  
1) Edit your *functions.php* file  
2) Use this code here (https://github.com/bacciotti/webhosting/blob/master/run_when_post_published/functions.php)

## The problem  
The slideshow allow just 7 posts. When the 8th is published, I manually had to change the "slideshow category" for other one.  

## The solution  
With this hook, I can update automatically if the post count is greater than 7.
