## Wordpress migration guide ##  
  
I wrote this tutorial to help me in the future if I have to migrate wordpress installations between servers again.  

### Step 1 - Install Duplicator ###
Install "Duplicator" plugin in the origin website. Activate it and go to the "Packages" tab, create a new Build and download the
"installer.php" and the "[weirdo-big-name-file]".  

If it is a small website, the "Build" will be processed with no issues. But if it is a big website, we have to go ahead on Step
1.1.  

#### Step 1.1 - What if my website was too big and Duplicator warn this? ####  
In this scenario, we have to use the "Two-step installation". We must "Build" just the database. The other files will be
transfered manually (Step 2).  

### Step 2 - How to migrate manually with SSH/SCP###
1 - Open Terminal (Mac) or Putty (Windows);
2 - Command to access server with SSH (SSH access must be allowed by the hosting):

>   ssh –p 2222 [username]@[your].[server].[origin].[ip]  

3 - Access the folder you want to copy with "cd" command;
4 - Command to copy files with SCP:

> scp –r –P 2222 * [username]@[server].[target].[ip]  :/your/new/server/path

5 - Wait until 100%.

### Step 3 - Smooth migration ###
If your website is small, it is not necessary to access by SSH and you must simply follow the Duplicator plugin steps:

a) Upload installer.php and the big-file.rar to your new server;
b) Change DNS;
c) Wait the DNS changes and access installer.php;
d) Input the database access info (the db must be created before, please be sure to take a note for these access info);
e) Next-next-finish.

### Step 4 - After migration ###
1 - Check if there are e-mail accounts in the old server. If yes, create the accounts in the new server and migrate the 
"mail" folder. After that, delete accounts on the old server;
2 - Delete domains, databases and files from the old server;
3 - Delete Duplicator`s installation files from the new server.
