## Wordpress migration guide ##  
  
I wrote this tutorial to help me in the future if I have to migrate wordpress installations between servers again.  

### Step 1 - Install Duplicator ###
Install "Duplicator" plugin in the origin website. Activate it and go to the "Packages" tab, create a new Build and download the
"installer.php" and the "[weirdo-big-name-file]".  

If it is a small website, the "Build" will be processed with no issues. But if it is a big website, we have to go ahead on Step
1.1.  

#### Step 1.1 - What if my website was too big and Duplicator warn this? ####  
In this scenario, we have to use the "Two-step installation". We must "Build" just the database. The other files will be
transfered manually (Step 2).  

### Step 2 - How to migrate manually with SSH/SCP###
